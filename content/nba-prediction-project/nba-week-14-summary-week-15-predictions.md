Our first ever 100% accuracy week! We will never beat this. Breakdown by point spread below, and new predictions are up.

In other news: This week, efavdb.com welcomes a new, official member to our team, [Damien Ramunno-Johnson](http://efavdb.com/about/)! He previously contributed two very interesting guest posts to the site, one on [facial recognition software](http://efavdb.com/machine-learning-for-facial-recognition-3/) and one on the [interpretation of wearable sensor data](http://efavdb.com/machine-learning-with-wearable-sensors/) (eg, [Jawbone's up band](https://jawbone.com/)). We aim to eventually bring site membership up to about four or five like-minded, yet complementary contributors, each interested in contributing about one machine-learning related post a month. We're especially excited to welcome Damien on board -- he's an old pal, and also one with a keen eye for finding topics of general interest. In fact, we're working on a joint post together right now that is both timely and interesting -- stay tuned!

Details of our perfect week:
