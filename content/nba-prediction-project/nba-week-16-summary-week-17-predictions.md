This week, we went 36 for 56, giving 64% accuracy -- decent. New predictions [are up](http://efavdb.com/weekly-nba-predictions/) -- again, lots of predicted upsets this week! One such upset predicted is a Clippers victory over the home team Warriors on Sunday... a game that one of us will be going to. Although we root for the local team, it's always hard to feel bad when our baby guesses correctly, so we'll be happy either way. Past week details below.
