This was an odd week in the NBA - plenty of upsets to go around.  You’re right, we’re making excuses - our NBA predictor had a tough week this round.  We had a total accuracy of 27/50 = 54%.  The summary by point spread is at right.  But seriously, who would have predicted results like back-to-back Laker victories over Atlanta and Houston (aside from die-hard Kobe fans)?  Well, we certainly didn’t.

For the coming week we have further refined our algorithm in two ways.  First, we have now incorporated a team’s away performance into their predicted home performance and vice-versa.  And second, we now select the parameters from our model with a more thorough and systematic cross-validation method.  Predictions are now up!
