This past week, we correctly predicted 51 of 93 games, which equates to a 54.8% accuracy. This is consistent with past weeks. It's strange that our accuracy level here is so far below what we were achieving for the NBA. Presumably, this represents some underlying increased variance in the MLB games that have happened so far. At any rate, our poor early start has motivated us to get back to work on algorithm improvements... New predictions are now [posted](http://efavdb.com/weekly-nba-predictions/).
