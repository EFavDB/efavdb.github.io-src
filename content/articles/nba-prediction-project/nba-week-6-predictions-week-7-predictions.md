$37/55 = 67.2%$ accuracy this week. Summary by point spread is at right.

This week, we have posted a beta of our [NBA dashboard](http://efavdb.com/nba-dash/).  A screenshot is given below -- the interactive version is linked to in our page's header.  We developed the tool using the programming language [processing](https://processing.org/) and displayed on the web using [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/). Our thanks to [Ann Hermundstad](http://annmh.com/) for introducing us to this tool, which we have really enjoyed!   The wheel design of the dashboard was inspired by Jawbone's correlated food [visual](https://jawbone.com/blog/jawbone-up-common-pairings/), by [Emi Nomura](https://twitter.com/eminomura).  We think this approach does a good job of quickly conveying the state of the league: both what has happened in prior games already, and what we think will happen in upcoming games.

Predictions for week 7 are now up.  They can now also be viewed on the dashboard using the third "Mode".
