Not a terribly impressive week for the NBA algorithm. We went 31/53, equating to 58% accuracy. New predictions [are up](http://efavdb.com/weekly-nba-predictions/) -- lots of predicted upsets this week, including two tonight. As usual, I've found checking the [dashboard](http://efavdb.com/nba-dash/) to be a great way to gain insight into such picks. Details of past week by point spread below.

| Point spread | # games | Accuracy |
| -- | -- | -- |
| < 5 | 10 | 40% |
| 5-9 | 13 | 62% |
| 10-14 | 14 | 64% |
| >14 | 16 | 63% |
