Tonight is the opening night of the 2014-15 NBA season.  This year, we
will be running a machine learning algorithm aimed at estimating
underlying features characterizing each team.  With these features, we
hope to identify interesting match-ups (including potential upsets),
similar team-playing-style categories, and win-loss probabilities for
future games.  As of now, the only source data that we intend to feed
our system will be win-loss results of completed games.  As the season
progresses, our algorithm will thus have more and more data informing
it —  It will be interesting to see if it can begin to provide
accurate predictions by the end of the season.  Stay tuned for
periodic updates on this experiment!
