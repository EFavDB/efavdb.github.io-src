Our NBA predictor did considerably better this week.  In fact, it did better than we even expected/hoped.  We had an accuracy of 40/51 = 78.4%, making up for last week’s lull.  

Week 4 predictions are now up.  This week set a high bar and our cross-validation indicates that the coming week may be harder to predict..  but we are still optimistic.
