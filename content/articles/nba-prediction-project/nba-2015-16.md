NBA is back this Tuesday! The [dashboard](http://efavdb.com/nba-dash/) and [weekly predictions](http://efavdb.com/weekly-nba-predictions/) are now live*, once again. These will each be updated daily, with game winner predictions, hypothetical who-would-beat-whom daily matchup predictions, and more. For a discussion on how we make our predictions, see our first [post](http://efavdb.com/nba-learner-2013-14-warmup/) on this topic. Note that our approach does not make use of any bookie predictions (unlike many other sites), and so provide an independent look on the game.

This season, we hope to crack 70% accuracy!

* Note that we have left up last season's completed games results, for review purposes. Once every team has played one game, we'll switch it over to the current season's results.
