Another good week for the NBA predictor: correct predictions for 39/53 = 73.6% of the games played.  This is an excellent result considering our algorithm had a difficult time cross-validating with this week’s results from last year.  Also, the 76ers won a game - there goes one of our sure-thing predictions.

Predictions for next week are up.  We are also working on a nice dynamic visualization for our NBA content - coming soon!
