**Announcing: EFavDB's first major league baseball prediction project!** Just as in our corresponding NBA project, we will be providing free-of-charge [game winner predictions](http://efavdb.com/weekly-mlb-predictions/) on a weekly basis. In addition, we've implemented a [MLB dashboard](http://efavdb.com/mlb-dash/) (screenshot above) where you can get a quick summary of each team's prior results. You can also use the dashboard to check out our guesses for who beat whom, were they to play today, etc.

The algorithm we'll be applying this season is similar to that discussed [here](http://efavdb.com/nba-learner-2013-14-warmup/), for the NBA. We've set its parameters to generate reasonably conservative predictions, but ones that will also lead to interesting upset predictions when appropriate. Unlike many other sites, our predictions do not take into account the over-under values published by bookies, and so are independent of their opinions. Looking forward to a great season!
