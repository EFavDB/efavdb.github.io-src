We have invested a bit of time to integrate our
[traffic visualization tool](http://efavdb.com/obtaining-and-visualizing-traffic-data/)
into R, taking advantage of [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and
[shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) to deploy an application for
visualizing our historically averaged traffic data for each day of the
week (see
[here](http://efavdb.com/historic-daily-traffic-patterns-and-the-time-scale/)).  We
hope this is a fun and interesting tool to play around
with.  Commuters may even find it useful.  It defaults to the current
day and time.

You can tinker with it below or visit [here](https://dmcintosh.shinyapps.io/traffic/).
