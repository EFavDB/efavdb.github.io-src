It has been quite awhile since I have posted, largely because soon after I started my job at Square I had a child! I hope to have some newer blog post soon. But along those lines I want to share a [blog post](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/making-ai-interpretable-with-generative-adversarial-networks-766abc953edf) I did with a coworkerÂ ([Juan Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-hernandez-025a5532/)) for Square that gives a taste of some of the cool data science work we have been up to. This post covers work we did to create a framework for making models interpretable.
