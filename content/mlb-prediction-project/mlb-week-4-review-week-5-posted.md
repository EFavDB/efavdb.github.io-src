Relatively poor results this past week, 44 of 94 games, 47% accuracy overall. Given our relatively strong performance in the NBA this past season, our early MLB results have been a bit disappointing. However, after doing a bit of learnin', we realized an interesting point: Professional baseball teams are simply much more balanced than their NBA counterparts. A statistic illustrating this point is provided by the winning rates of the top teams: This past year, the Warriors had a win rate just over 80%, while the top team in the MLB last season, the Angels, had just under a 61% win rate. This difference explains why we can't achieve 70% win prediction accuracy in the MLB. Instead, we'll be shooting for just 56% accuracy this season -- this may sound modest, but we expect this rate will be a challenge to meet. To work towards that goal, we've already begun to implement a number of improvements to our algorithm. New predictions are [posted](http://efavdb.com/weekly-nba-predictions/).
