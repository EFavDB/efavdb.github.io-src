Welcome to EFavDB (Everybody's Favorite Data Blog)! The site is run by 
four physicists interested in statistics and data science. We write here
on learnings picked up on the job and in personal projects -- the aim being
to build up a broad library of resources of interest to the data science
community. Hope you enjoy!

Those interested in hiring us for consulting projects should feel free
to contact us on social media -- either via private tweet or directly
on LinkedIn. We specialize in various aspects of data science and math
modeling and are also available for in-office tutorials.
