Welcome to EFavDB.com -- a site devoted to machine learning and
data science! The site is run by four physics PhDs practicing
data science in the Bay Area. We write here on learnings picked up on
the job and in personal projects -- the aim being to build up a broad
library of tutorial resources for the data science community. Hope you
enjoy!

Those interested in hiring us for consulting projects should feel free
to contact us on social media -- either via private tweet or directly
on LinkedIN. We specialize in various aspects of data science and math
modeling and are also available for in-office tutorials.
