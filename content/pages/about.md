Welcome to EFavDB.com -- a site devoted to machine-learning and
data-science! The site is run by four physics PhDs practicing
data-science in the Bay Area (bios below). We write here on learnings
picked up on the job and in personal projects -- the aim being to
build up a broad library of tutorial resources for the data-science
community. Hope you enjoy!

Prior posts can be found in the
[archives](http://efavdb.com/archives/). Follow @efavdb for new
submission alerts.

Those interested in hiring us for consulting projects should feel free
to contact us on social media -- either via private tweet or directly
on LinkedIN. We specialize in various aspects of data-science and math
modeling and are also available for in-office tutorials.

Landy ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=259212684))
grew up in the midwest and then went to school at Caltech
and UCLA. Following this, he did two postdocs, one at UCSB and one at
UC Berkeley.  His academic research focused primarily on applications
of statistical mechanics, but his professional passion has always been
in the mastering, development, and practical application of slick math
methods/tools. He worked as a data-scientist at Square for four years
and is now working on a quantitative investing startup.

[posts](http://efavdb.com/author/damienrj/)) is a highly experienced
researcher with a background in clinical and applied research. Like,
JSL, he got his PhD at UCLA. He has many years of experience working
with imaging, and has a particularly strong background in image
segmentation, registration, detection, data analysis, and more
recently machine learning. He now works as a data-scientist at Square
in San Francisco.

Cathy Yeh got a PhD at UC Santa Barbara studying soft-matter/polymer
physics. She is currently looking to transition to a career in data
science after wrapping up work with the translational modeling group
in a pharmaceutical company in San Diego. She enjoys mining big data
and big ice cream and seeing how both can help make the world a better
place.

McIntosh
([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=33554236)) got a
B.S in Engineering Physics from the Colorado School of Mines (Golden,
CO) before moving to UC Santa Barbara for graduate school. There he
became interested in Soft Condensed Matter Physics and Polymer
Physics, studying the interaction between single DNA molecules and
salt ions
([Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pw2Vdu0AAAAJ&hl=en)). After
a brief postdoc at UC San Diego studying the physics of bacterial
growth, Dustin decided to move into the data science business for
good - he is now a Quantitative Analyst at Google in Mountain View.
